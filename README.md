# Description

ReservNFT is a full-stack decentralized application designed as a proof-of-concept for tokenized reservations. The front-end is built with NextJS while the backend is built with Solidity using the Foundry framework. This project was built for Duke University's Blockchain I course. The demo can be found at https://jolly-voice-8243.on.fleek.co/. 

NOTE: The demo project uses the Graph protocol which will archive the graphql backend if no queries are made within 30 days.
